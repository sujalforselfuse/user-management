# Getting Started with Create React App

This is user management site and currently is only available for desktop. I can made it responsive as per the figma.

##### Standard practise is not to  expose .env file but to make evaluation easy, I am adding it here.

## Available Scripts

To start the project, you have to :


### For React Site :- `npm start`

### For Backend :- `index.js ` in backend directory
